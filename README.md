# BALLBOT
## Project description
This project aims to recreate the maze game with a ball. This ball will move with the movement of the board, in order to reach the final destination.
To give it a different point of view, it will be the same BALLBOT who moves the board, and it will be the player who designs the circuit. Therefore, the robot must be able to adapt to the board each time the user modifies it.
In addition, there will be a screen showing the circuit that captures the camera, and the circuit that the robot has calculated to take the ball to its final destination will be drawn in real time.

The connections will go as follow:
- Both power supplies will be connected to a Power Bank
- Camera connected to Raspberry Pi camera module
- Screen connected to Raspberry Pi display module
- Raspberry Pi pin 6 (GND) to PCA9665 GND pin
- Raspberry Pi pin 2 (5V) to PCA9665 VCC pin
- Raspberry Pi pin 3 (GPIO 2) to PCA9665 SDA pin
- Raspberry Pi pin 5 (GPIO 3) to PCA9665 SCL pin
- 3 servos connected to PCA9665 0, 8 and 15

## Software Architecture
## Software design

- Board treatment: Identify the structure of the maze (position and orientation
of the walls, identification of start and goal points).
- Ball treatment: identifying the ball's position; necessary for calculating the
path to follow.
- Search algorithm: determine the path the ball must follow to reach the goal
point (there are different types of search algorithms, for example:
backtracking, branch&bound).
- The module indicates to the servos what type of movement they need to
perform (orientation, force, etc.)

## Amazing contributions 
The following features make our project unique:
- The structure of the maze is built through user interaction.
- Mazes can be solved in an infinite number of ways.
- The robot's ability to guide the ball to the goal.
- Control of the edges, because the ball cannot go out of the board.
- Device for displaying the path to be taken, or the path that is currently being taken.
