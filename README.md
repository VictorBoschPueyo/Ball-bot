# BALLBOT
## Project description
This project aims to recreate the maze game with a ball. This ball will move with the movement of the board, in order to reach the final destination.
To give it a different point of view, it will be the same BALLBOT who moves the board, and it will be the player who designs the circuit. Therefore, the robot must be able to adapt to the board each time the user modifies it.
In addition, there will be a screen showing the circuit that captures the camera, and the circuit that the robot has calculated to take the ball to its final destination will be drawn in real time.

## Electronic components
- RASPBERRY PI 3
- CAMERA
- SD
- SERVOMOTOR (3)
- SCREEN

## Amazing contributions 
The following features make our project unique:
- The structure of the maze is built through user interaction.
- Mazes can be solved in an infinite number of ways.
- The robot's ability to guide the ball to the goal.
- Control of the edges, because the ball cannot go out of the board.
- Device for displaying the path to be taken, or the path that is currently being taken.
